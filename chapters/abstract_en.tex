The bachelor's thesis deals with the design and implementation of a software
solution for the evaluation of cardiac activity in the MATLAB and Python
software environment. The main goal is to design an adaptive algorithm in the
MATLAB environment, that will be able to perform offline analysis on the
measured ECG signal loaded with artifacts using a Poincar√© graph. For the
evaluation of the processed records, the analysis in the time domain was
selected, specifically the variability of the heart rate and the parameters
based on it. Another goal of this work is to design and implement a solution
with a GUI for online evaluation of cardiac activity in the Python environment.
For testing of the proposed solution, short-term records measured in a total of
5 probands were used. During the measurement, the probands were first at rest
and then each of them was exposed to a situation that stimulates cognitive
stress. Each of the probands was monitored during the measurement by Holter, a
portable electrocardiogram. The result of the work is a set of scripts
implemented in the MATLAB environment capable to adaptively process the ECG
offline and display graphs of the parameters demonstrating the correlation of
cognitive load with heart rate variability over time. A multiplatform Python GUI
application was programmed to extend the output for online measurement.
