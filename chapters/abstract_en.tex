This bachelor's work describes designing and implementing a software
solution to evaluate cardiac activity in MATLAB and Python
software environments. The main goal is to design an adaptive algorithm in the
MATLAB environment, that will perform offline analysis of the
measured ECG signal with artefact. The nonlinear geometric method of the
Poincar√© graph was chosen for the analysis of the processed record, which
evaluates the variability of the heart rate. Another goal of this work is to
design and implement a solution with a GUI for the online evaluation of cardiac
activity in the Python environment. For testing the proposed solution,
short-term records measured in a total of 5 probands were used. During the
measurement, the probands were first at rest, and then each of them was exposed
to a situation that stimulates cognitive stress. Each of the probands was
monitored during the measurement by Holter, a portable electrocardiogram. The
result of the work is a MATLAB application capable of adaptively processing the
measured ECG recordings and displaying graphs of parameters demonstrating the
correlation of cognitive load with HRV over time. A
multiplatform Python GUI application was programmed, extending the output within
the online measurement and processing of ECG.
